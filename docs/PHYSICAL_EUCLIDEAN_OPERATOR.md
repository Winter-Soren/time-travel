# A common physical Euclidean Dirac operator

Update152: the [uniform low-energy limit and zero-state test](#uniform-low-energy-limit-and-zero-state-test) now prove joint convergence on bounded Hamiltonian energies if zero states are absent, or for the signed-mass average under an explicit weighted-zero density condition. That condition is not yet verified for the sewn geometry. An abstract counterexample shows why symmetry alone is insufficient; high-energy and regulator limits remain open.

Update151: the [localized Green identity and proper-mass limit](#localized-green-identity-and-proper-mass-limit) below close the positive-mass correspondence and the massless limit at fixed nonzero frequency without an upper lapse bound. The joint infrared limit and stress coincidence remain unresolved. No physical supporting stress is reported.

Increment137. This constructs the common positive operator needed by the
fixed-mass PV identity in [136](DIRAC_SCHEME_MATCHING.md). The background is
the exact smooth sewn manifold, magnetic bundle and chosen spin/flat-phase
sewing of [133](SEWN_SOURCE_STATE.md). The ultraviolet reference is now136's
explicit physical heat/zeta action; equality to133's point-split prescription
is not assumed. No absorbing numerical boundary is introduced below.

## Physical geometry, Hilbert spaces and domains

Write the static metric as $g=-N^2dt^2+h$, with $N>0$, and its Euclidean
section as $g_E=N^2d\tau^2+h$ on $\mathbb R_\tau\times\Sigma$. The connection
is spatial and unitary, with the same integer charge, polar patches and
handle phase as133. The four-component field is vectorlike.

The **physical** spatial metric $h$ is complete as well as the optical metric.
Indeed, the exact positive balanced exterior has
$N=\Lambda\ge1-2Mr/\Sigma_g$, where
$\Sigma_g=r^2-a_g^2\cos^2\theta$. This lower bound tends uniformly to1
at infinity; the lapse itself need not do so. The remaining terms in the numerator of
$\Lambda$ are nonnegative; see [Emparan, equations8--10](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/9906160).
The bridge and remaining bounded exterior are smooth with positive lapse,
so $N\ge c_N>0$ globally. Hence $h=N^2\widehat h\ge c_N^2\widehat h$,
and133's optical completeness implies physical completeness. A finite-length
Euclidean curve has a finite-length spatial projection, which converges in
$h$; near its limit $N$ has a positive lower bound, so its time coordinate
also cannot escape. Thus $g_E$ is complete. There is no horizon or Euclidean
bolt in the sewn geometry. The compact paired variations preserve this result.

Use Hamiltonian and Euclidean spatial norms

$$
\mathcal H=L^2(\Sigma,d\mathrm{vol}_h;S_4\otimes L_q),\qquad
\mathcal H_E=L^2(\Sigma,N\,d\mathrm{vol}_h;S_4\otimes L_q).
$$

The full Euclidean norm additionally integrates $d\tau$. Fix Hermitian
Hamiltonian matrices $\alpha^a,\beta$, with $\beta^2=I$ and
$\{\beta,\alpha^a\}=0$. In the project's chiral representation,
$H_0=\operatorname{diag}(h_W,-h_W)$ and
$\beta=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0&I\\I&0\end{smallmatrix}\right)$.
Here $h_W$ includes the physical lapse connection:

$$
H_0=-iN\alpha^i\left(\nabla_i^{h,A}
+\tfrac12\partial_i\log N\right),\qquad \{\beta,H_0\}=0.
$$

Choose Euclidean Clifford matrices $\gamma^0=\beta$,
$\gamma^i=-i\beta\alpha^i$. The skew-Hermitian physical Dirac expression is

$$
\boxed{\mathcal D_E
=\beta N^{-1}\partial_\tau
+\gamma^i\left(\nabla_i^{h,A}+\tfrac12\partial_i\log N\right)
=N^{-1}\beta(\partial_\tau+H_0).}
$$

The convention differs by a factor of $i$ from a self-adjoint Euclidean
Dirac operator. The local Clifford-connection square is the usual
Laplace-type operator; compare [Vassilevich, equations3.26--3.28](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0306138).
On the complete smooth twisted Dirac bundle, $-i\mathcal D_E$ and its square
are essentially self-adjoint on compact smooth sections by
[Bandara--Saratchandran, section3.1 and theorem3.5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.06190).
Their hypotheses concern the complete metric and compatible smooth unitary
connection, not a bounded global gauge potential. Define

$$
\mathscr P=\overline{\mathcal D_E}^{\,\dagger}
\overline{\mathcal D_E}\ge0.
$$

All proper scalar masses use this same realization:
$(\mathcal D_E+m)^\dagger(\mathcal D_E+m)=\mathscr P+m^2$.
The first-order Euclidean domains are identical for finite $m$, since $mI$
is bounded. This does not assert identical maximal domains for the physical
Hamiltonians $H_m=H_0+mN\beta$, whose multiplication coefficient $N$ is unbounded.

## Fourier fibre and a form that can be assembled

Use $e^{i\kappa\tau}$, so $\partial_\tau=i\kappa$ and
$A_\kappa=i\kappa+H_0$. Existing $H_m-i\kappa$ conventions correspond to
$\kappa\mapsto-\kappa$. The Euclidean fibre and its positive form are

$$
\mathcal D_\kappa=N^{-1}\beta A_\kappa,\qquad
q_\kappa[u,v]=\langle A_\kappa u,N^{-1}A_\kappa v\rangle_{\mathcal H},
\qquad n[u,v]=\langle u,Nv\rangle_{\mathcal H}.
$$

Weighted adjunction gives $\mathcal D_\kappa^{\dagger_E}=-\mathcal D_\kappa$.
The unitary map $U_Nu=N^{1/2}u$ from $\mathcal H_E$ to $\mathcal H$ yields

$$
\widehat{\mathcal D}_\kappa
=D_h+i\kappa\beta/N,
\qquad D_h=\gamma^i\nabla_i^{h,A}.
$$

The spatial Dirac operator $-iD_h$ is self-adjoint on complete $h$, and
$\kappa\beta/N$ is bounded. Thus every real-$\kappa$ fibre has a definite
closure with a common spatial first-order domain; $q_\kappa$ is its closed
norm-square form. Axial projections reduce it with the global labels and
gauge transitions of133. The associated $P_\kappa$ is the Fourier fibre
of $\mathscr P$. This conclusion does not give a positive spectral gap:
even $\kappa\ne0$ supplies no uniform lower bound through $\kappa^2/N^2$.

For real $m$,

$$
\mathcal D_\kappa+m=N^{-1}\beta(i\kappa+H_m),\qquad
\boxed{q_{\kappa,m}=q_\kappa+m^2 n.}
$$

The cross term vanishes because
$(H_0-i\kappa)\beta+\beta(H_0+i\kappa)=0$ on the core. Closure gives the
same form identity. For conforming trial sections $\phi_a$, assemble

$$
G_{ab}=n[\phi_a,\phi_b],\qquad Q_{ab}=q_\kappa[\phi_a,\phi_b],\qquad
P_G=G^{-1/2}QG^{-1/2}.
$$

Every regulator is the **same** matrix pencil $Q+jM^2G$. Integrate the
actual differential actions in $Q$, including their components outside
the trial space. Squaring a projected first-order matrix generally omits
those components and gives a different form. This distinction is testable
with a basis that is not invariant under the differential operator.

## Bridge flux variables and the exact paired variation

For one Weyl field, the133 bridge flux amplitude is
$v_b=R\sqrt{P\sin\theta}\,\Psi_\mu$, with measure $ds\,d\theta$ before
weights. Set $W=P/N$ and

$$
T_W=-i\sigma_3\partial_s+\mathcal K/R,\qquad
\mathcal K=-i\sigma_1\partial_\theta
+\sigma_2\frac{NP(\mu-qa)}{\sin\theta}.
$$

Use the regular polar spin/gauge domain, not arbitrary endpoint conditions
on this coordinate expression. For the full field let
$T_4=\operatorname{diag}(T_W,-T_W)=F+\mathcal A$,
$F=-i\Sigma\partial_s$, $\Sigma=\operatorname{diag}(\sigma_3,-\sigma_3)$,
and $\mathcal A=\operatorname{diag}(\mathcal K/R,-\mathcal K/R)$.
Then

$$
H_0=W^{-1}T_4,\quad
\mathcal D_\kappa=P^{-1}\beta(i\kappa W+T_4),\quad
n_b[v]=\int P|v|^2,\quad
q_{\kappa,b}[v]=\int\left|P^{-1/2}(i\kappa W+T_4)v\right|^2.
$$

For $N_\epsilon=e^{\epsilon f(s)}N$ and
$h_{ss,\epsilon}=e^{-2\epsilon f(s)}h_{ss}$, keep the other spatial
coefficients and $A$ fixed. The physical volume $N_\epsilon\sqrt{h_\epsilon}$
is unchanged. In the varying flux coordinates, however,

$$
W_\epsilon=e^{-2\epsilon f}W,\qquad
T_{4,\epsilon}=F+e^{-\epsilon f}\mathcal A,\qquad
P_\epsilon=N_\epsilon W_\epsilon=e^{-\epsilon f}P.
$$

Here $P_\epsilon$ denotes the Euclidean flux density; it is not a replacement
of $P$ in all angular metric components. The unitary fixed-space identification
is $v_\epsilon=J_\epsilon v$, $J_\epsilon=e^{\epsilon f/2}$, from baseline
$L^2(P\,dsd\theta)$ to $L^2(P_\epsilon\,dsd\theta)$. Therefore

$$
q_{\kappa,\epsilon}[J_\epsilon v]=\|L_\epsilon v\|_{L^2(dsd\theta)}^2,
$$
$$
\boxed{L_\epsilon=P^{-1/2}\left[
e^{-\epsilon f}i\kappa W
+e^{\epsilon f}\left(F-\tfrac{i\epsilon}{2}f'\Sigma\right)
+\mathcal A\right],\qquad
\dot L=P^{-1/2}\left[-i\kappa fW+fF-\tfrac i2f'\Sigma\right].}
$$

The $f'$ term comes from differentiating $J_\epsilon v$ and cannot be
dropped. The angular operator cancels from $\dot L$, but remains in $L$:
$\dot q[u,v]=\langle\dot Lu,Lv\rangle+\langle Lu,\dot Lv\rangle$.
The norm matrix $G$ and proper mass term $m^2G$ are constant under this
identification. Compact smooth variations give equivalent form graph norms
by local elliptic estimates and unchanged coefficients outside the support.

For the exterior amplitude $v_e=\sqrt P\,\Psi_\mu$, the corresponding
Hamiltonian and Euclidean weights are $\rho W$ and $\rho P$. Use

$$
T_{e,W}=-i\sigma_x(\partial_\rho+1/(2\rho))
-i\sigma_z\partial_z+\sigma_y NP(\mu-qa)/\rho
$$

and the same formulas with measure $\rho\,d\rho dz$. At each mouth the
physical trace relation is
$v_b=R_c\sqrt{\sin\theta}\,U_{R,L}^\dagger v_e$, with133's fixed spin lift
and flat phase. These are internal sewing conditions, not absorbing ends.

## Relation to first-order determinants and what remains

On the smooth core there is the exact congruence

$$
\widehat{\mathcal D}_\kappa+m
=\beta N^{-1/2}(H_m+i\kappa)N^{-1/2}.
$$

It is not similarity to $H_m+i\kappa$. In a common finite representation
that respects this factorization exactly,

$$
\log\det(P_\kappa+m^2)
=2\Re\log\det(H_m+i\kappa)-2\log\det N.
$$

The mass-independent lapse factor cancels in the common PV sum because
$\sum c_j=0$. This algebra does not authorize separate multiplicative
factorizations of infinite-dimensional zeta determinants. The continuum
comparison requires the common domains, Hilbert identification, and a
jointly regulated relative trace permitting the cyclic operations.
In particular $N^{1/2}$ is unbounded at infinity. Boundary terms and the
local normalization must remain those of the chosen physical action.

Under those conditions the parity-even full-Dirac normalization is
$-\tfrac12\int d\kappa/(2\pi)\,\log\det(P_\kappa+m^2)$, equivalently
$-1/\pi\int_0^\infty\Re\log\det(H_m-i\kappa)\,d\kappa$ after the common
normalization. There is no further Weyl doubling. The136 local subtraction
is still required when the proper regulator mass tends to infinity.

A form-supported calculation on a finite bridge with zero traces converges,
at fixed cuts, to an artificial Dirichlet form problem. It does not replace
the natural full sewn exterior. Genuine conforming global trials must match
the bundle/spin traces and exhaust the physical domain, or come with a
controlled exterior resolvent/form reduction. Existing absorbing DG matrices
have neither been squared into this realization nor proved equivalent to it.

The immediate implementable object is $Q$, $G$ and $\dot Q$ from the displayed
forms, with all masses sharing $Q+jM^2G$. This settles operator and measure
normalization. Spatial/exterior, angular and frequency remainders remain to
be bounded. The infinite-volume relative trace and infrared limit, including
derivatives at zero crossings, are separate: retain133's empty exact-zero
prescription and do not silently replace it by a finite-temperature limit.
No renormalized supporting stress or physical throat solution follows from
this construction alone.

## Remainders tied to the physical source test

These are our conditional estimates for the common operator above, not
evaluated error bars. They identify what the next global calculation must
measure. All traces are per unit Euclidean Killing time and the compact
metric variation is represented on the fixed Euclidean Hilbert space.
Write its symmetric form as $\delta P=L_f^\dagger J_fL_f$, where $L_f$ is a
first-order row operator with compact spatial support and
$\|J_f\|\le C_f$. Define a positive and a signed local spectral measure:

$$
\mu_f(B)=\operatorname{Tr}_{/\mathcal T}
 [L_fE_P(B)L_f^\dagger],\qquad
\nu_f(B)=\operatorname{Tr}_{/\mathcal T}
 [J_fL_fE_P(B)L_f^\dagger],\qquad |\nu_f|\le C_f\mu_f.
$$

Whenever the indicated relative trace exists, the exact136 resolvent
identity gives

$$
Q_M=-\int_0^\infty w_M(\lambda)\,d\nu_f(\lambda),\qquad
w_M(\lambda)=\frac{3M^6}
 {\lambda(\lambda+M^2)(\lambda+2M^2)(\lambda+3M^2)}.
$$

For a **uniform proved bound** $\mu_f([0,\lambda])\le A\lambda^3$ for
every $\lambda\ge\lambda_*$, integration by parts, dropping the nonpositive
lower-end term, and $-w_M'(\lambda)\le12M^6\lambda^{-5}$ imply

$$
|Q_M^{\lambda\ge\lambda_*}|\le\frac{12C_fAM^6}{\lambda_*}.
$$

The cutoff $\lambda_*$ has units of mass squared. A local Weyl asymptotic
alone supplies neither this uniform inequality nor its constant $A$.
The bound is on the exact spectral projection of $P$, not on eigenvalues
of a separately compressed determinant.

In the infrared $w_M(\lambda)\sim1/(2\lambda)$. Absolute convergence of
the signed scalar response at zero requires and, away from zero atoms,
is equivalent to

$$
\int_{(0,\eta)}\lambda^{-1}\,d|\nu_f|(\lambda)<\infty.
$$

A stronger sufficient condition uses $C_f\mu_f$. For example, if
$\mu_f([0,\lambda])\le B\lambda^{1+\epsilon}$ at small $\lambda$, with
$\epsilon>0$, then $w_M\le1/(2\lambda)$ and integration by parts give

$$
|Q_M^{0<\lambda<\eta}|
\le\frac{C_fB(1+\epsilon)}{2\epsilon}\eta^\epsilon.
$$

No such threshold estimate has been proved here. Exact zero atoms and
differentiation through zero crossings retain the separate state convention;
a positive finite-trial eigenvalue does not settle them.

The paired variation offers a more efficient possible UV route. Since
$\delta a_0=0$, the signed inserted heat trace is formally

$$
h_f(s)=\operatorname{Tr}_{/\mathcal T}(\delta P e^{-sP})
=-\frac1s\delta\operatorname{Tr}_{/\mathcal T}e^{-sP}
\sim-\frac{a_2'}{16\pi^2s^2}-\frac{a_4'}{16\pi^2s}+O(1),
$$

where136 already supplies $a_2'=0.11400999281577749D$ and
$a_4'=7.706927314195081/D$. If a remainder estimate establishes
$|h_f(s)|\le H_2s^{-2}$ throughout $0<s\le s_0$, then

$$
\left| -\tfrac12\int_0^{s_0}(1-e^{-sM^2})^3h_f(s)\,ds\right|
\le\frac{H_2M^6s_0^2}{4}.
$$

This follows directly from $1-e^{-sM^2}\le sM^2$. The asymptotic coefficients
do not prove $H_2$, and this signed cancellation is not an estimate of the
total-variation spectral measure. The heat/resolvent framework is given in
[Vassilevich, sections1--2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0306138); the displayed
conditional bounds are derived here for this response.

For one Dirac field define the final, dimensionless physical response by
$Q_{\rm HK}=(\hbar c/D)C$. At the prescribed dimensionless geometry, the
existing masked non-Maxwell source target is

$$
Q_{\rm required}=-\frac{0.171015352199415\,c^4D}{8\pi G},\qquad
\boxed{C_{\rm required}=-0.006804484661784583\,(D/\ell_P)^2},\quad
\ell_P^2=\hbar G/c^3.
$$

Only after global fixed-$M$ control,136's local subtraction and regulator
removal can an interval for $C$ be compared to that target. This is a
necessary smeared Einstein-equation test, not a sufficient throat solution:
other stress components, induced current, backreaction and stability remain.
No finite compact-trial response in137, or absorbing total in136, is an
estimate of $C$ with a known remainder. The next calculation therefore needs
globally sewn trial traces or a controlled physical exterior reduction,
not more refinement of the isolated bridge Dirichlet problem.

The focused [implementation](../scripts/dihole_euclidean_form.py) exposes
`trial_data(bridge, radial_modes=3, radial_order=64)` and
`assemble(data, kappa, epsilon=0., mass=0.)`, returning `q`, `norm`,
`derivative` and `direct_massive` among its controls. Its
[saved results](../results/dihole_euclidean_form_results.json) use actual
bridge coefficients and compact $H^1$ sine trials in three azimuthal sectors.
The assembly evaluates multiplication by $P^{-1}$ pointwise, retains the
$f'$ term, and compares the direct massive form with $Q+m^2G$. These are
finite form/variation checks. The trials vanish at the mouth cuts, and
neither this calculation nor its refinement contains the sewn exterior.

## Local infrared target: a gap is not needed for source existence

Under the declared smooth geometry, natural self-adjoint Hamiltonian and
Hadamard state, the compact collar stress integral is finite. The local
two-point function minus its Hadamard parametrix is smooth, so its stress
differential coincidence limit is smooth. See
[Zahn, Proposition 3.6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.4031) and the
[Sahlmann–Verch ground-state result](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math-ph/0002021).
This settles local observable existence under those hypotheses; it does not
prove the stronger absolute common-P trace estimate or every limit exchange
used by the numerical prescription.

There is also a gap-free localized Hamiltonian remainder lemma. Let
$E_0=\mathbf1_{[-E_*,E_*]}(H)$ and

$$g_\epsilon(\lambda)=\frac2\pi\operatorname{sgn}(\lambda)
\arctan\frac{\epsilon}{|\lambda|},\qquad g_\epsilon(0)=0.$$

For compactly supported differential operators $L_i$, local elliptic
estimates and bounded spectral support imply $A_i=L_iE_0$ is Hilbert–Schmidt:
factor through a sufficiently high compact Sobolev embedding. Since
$g_\epsilon(H)$ is bounded uniformly and tends strongly to zero,

$$L_1g_\epsilon(H)E_0L_2^*=A_1g_\epsilon(H)A_2^*\longrightarrow0
\quad\text{in trace norm}.$$

For any $\delta>0$, one explicit estimate is

$$
\|A_1g_\epsilon(H)A_2^*\|_1\le\|A_1\|_2
\left[\|\mathbf1_{\{0<|H|\le\delta\}}A_2^*\|_2
+\frac{2\epsilon}{\pi\delta}\|A_2\|_2\right].
$$

First take $\delta$ small, then $\epsilon$ small. The local spectral weight
vanishes as $\delta\downarrow0$ with exact zeros excluded; no inverse-energy
moment is needed. Applying the argument to arbitrary derivatives gives
localized kernel convergence in every finite Sobolev order and hence every
finite $C^r$ norm, allowing the differentiated diagonal on this low-Hamiltonian-
energy part. A computable rate still requires a bound on that spectral weight;
the high-energy part requires the separate existing UV subtraction.

The empty-zero covariance is $(I-\operatorname{sgn}H-P_0)/2$. For this
full-Dirac massless metric probe $V=\delta H_0$, the fixed identification gives
$\beta H_0\beta=-H_0$, $\beta V\beta=-V$, and $[\beta,P_0]=0$.
The localized compression $P_0VP_0$ is trace class by the same smoothing
argument, and its trace equals its own negative under conjugation by
$\beta$. Thus its zero-occupation correction vanishes for this probe.
This is not a claim for every observable, each Weyl block, or ground-energy
differentiability: $H_\epsilon=\epsilon\sigma_z$, $\beta=\sigma_x$ already
has vacuum energy $-|\epsilon|$.

The unresolved representation step is specific. The actual numerical
infrared cutoff concerns proper Euclidean $P$, not low $|H|$. The lapse is
unbounded at Melvin infinity, so the formal inverse associated with
$\widehat{\mathcal D}_\kappa=\beta N^{-1/2}(H+i\kappa)N^{-1/2}$ must be
justified as a compactly localized Green-kernel identity, not assumed to be
a bounded global inverse. One must then identify its stress-differentiated
common-P limit with the covariance above, retaining the correct lapse factors,
UV subtraction and ordered limits. The lemma removes an unnecessarily strong
absolute-IR premise on the Hamiltonian target; it does not automatically
authorize the present proper-P trace and limit interchanges.

## Localized Green identity and proper-mass limit

Increment151 resolves part of the representation problem just stated.
It uses the existing complete sewn geometry and self-adjoint domains, with
$N\ge c_N>0$ but no finite upper bound on $N$. These are analytic results
for that assumed geometry, not measurements or a new physical law.
The [finite algebra controls](../scripts/dirac_green_mass_limit.py) and
[saved results](../results/dirac_green_mass_limit_results.json) check the
factors independently; they do not approximate the bridge stress.

![Green correspondence and remaining source calculation](../figures/dirac_green_mass_limit_progress.png)

### A positive proper mass gives a Hamiltonian gap

Write $A_\kappa=\widehat{\mathcal D}_\kappa$ on the canonical spatial
Hilbert space, $B=N^{-1/2}$ and $H_m=H_0+mN\beta$. Here $A_\kappa$
is skew-adjoint, $B$ is bounded, and each $H_m$ has the self-adjoint
maximal domain established above. On the common compact smooth core,

$$\operatorname{Re}\langle\beta u,H_mu\rangle
=m\langle u,Nu\rangle.$$

The massless term has zero real part because $\{\beta,H_0\}=0$.
Cauchy--Schwarz and $N\ge c_N$ imply

$$\|H_mu\|\ge |m|c_N\|u\|.$$

This inequality extends by graph closure without assuming that every
vector in $D(H_m)$ belongs separately to $D(N)$. Self-adjointness then gives

$$\operatorname{spec}(H_m)\cap(-|m|c_N,|m|c_N)=\varnothing,
\qquad
\|(H_m+i\kappa)^{-1}\|\le
\frac1{\sqrt{\kappa^2+m^2c_N^2}}.$$

This is a mass-dependent gap. It supplies no gap at $m=0$.

### Compact Green identity without a bounded global lapse

For $m\ne0$, skew-adjointness gives a bounded inverse
$(A_\kappa+m)^{-1}$ with norm at most $1/|m|$. Take compactly
supported $f$ and put $u=(A_\kappa+m)^{-1}f$, $v=Bu$.
The already derived differential congruence implies, distributionally,

$$ (H_m+i\kappa)v=N^{1/2}\beta f.$$

Both $v$ and the right side are in the canonical $L^2$ space. The maximal
domain of $H_m$ therefore places $v$ in $D(H_m)$, so its resolvent
determines $v$ uniquely. For compact smooth spatial multipliers $a,b$,

$$\boxed{a(A_\kappa+m)^{-1}b
=aN^{1/2}(H_m+i\kappa)^{-1}N^{1/2}\beta b.}$$

In particular,

$$\|a(A_\kappa+m)^{-1}b\|
\le\frac{\|a\sqrt N\|_\infty\|b\sqrt N\|_\infty}
{\sqrt{\kappa^2+m^2c_N^2}}.$$

The factors are finite on the compact supports. This proof does not treat
$N^{1/2}$ as a bounded global map and does not assume a bounded global
inverse for the massless Euclidean fibre. For a compact source its actual
positive-mass solution also verifies the required weighted-domain condition.

### What removing the proper-mass shift proves

For a common positive shift $\eta$ of the proper squared operator,

$$P_\kappa+jM^2+\eta
=(A_\kappa+m_j)^\dagger(A_\kappa+m_j),
\qquad m_j=\sqrt{jM^2+\eta}.$$

This is a proper scalar mass, not $m_j=\sqrt jM+\sqrt\eta$ and not
$\kappa\mapsto\sqrt{\kappa^2+\eta}$. A nonconstant lapse matters.
For $m=\sqrt\eta$, functional calculus for the skew-adjoint $A_\kappa$
gives the exact identities

$$ (P_\kappa+m^2)^{-1}
=\frac{(A_\kappa+m)^{-1}-(A_\kappa-m)^{-1}}{2m},$$
$$\boxed{-A_\kappa(P_\kappa+m^2)^{-1}
=\tfrac12\left[(A_\kappa+m)^{-1}+(A_\kappa-m)^{-1}\right].}$$

On the common compact core, $H_mu\to H_0u$ as $m\to0$.
This implies strong resolvent convergence: for the dense set
$f=(H_0+i)u$, the resolvent identity bounds the difference by
$\|(H_m-H_0)u\|$, and the resolvent norms are uniformly bounded.
No norm-small bound on the global multiplication operator $mN$ is used.

Consequently, at each fixed $\kappa\ne0$, both localized first-order
inverses in the box converge strongly to

$$G_{0,\kappa}^{a,b}
=aN^{1/2}(H_0+i\kappa)^{-1}N^{1/2}\beta b.$$

Thus the **Dirac-weighted** proper-$P$ inverse has the natural local
massless Green limit. The bare squared inverse has an additional $1/m$
in its difference formula and has not been assigned the same conclusion.
The bound $C_{a,b}/|\kappa|$ also permits integration over any finite
frequency band bounded away from zero, in the strong/weak distributional
sense. Spatial derivatives are continuous on distributions. Evaluation
on the diagonal is not, so this argument alone does not prove a
stress-coincidence limit.

### The common regulated stress trace at positive shift

Let $A=\widehat{\mathcal D}_E$, $P=A^\dagger A=-A^2$ on the full
Euclidean spacetime, and keep the same fixed Hilbert identification for
the compact static metric variation. Put

$$R_\eta=\sum_{j=0}^3c_j(P+\eta+jM^2)^{-1},\qquad
S_\eta=-AR_\eta,\qquad c=(1,-3,3,-1).$$

At fixed $\eta>0$ the common response exists as the compact relative
trace per unit Killing time. Its heat representation has weight
$e^{-\eta s}(1-e^{-M^2s})^3$. The compact second-order inserted heat
trace is $O(s^{-3})$ at small $s$, so their product is bounded there;
at large $s$ the positive shift supplies exponential decay. Equivalently,
the common local orders are $R_\eta:-8$, $S_\eta:-7$ and
$\delta A S_\eta:-6$, below the four-dimensional trace-class threshold.
With the compact form factorization of the insertion, local heat smoothing
controls the large-$s$ trace before multiplication by $e^{-\eta s}$.
The local heat expansion used here is described in
[Vassilevich, section2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-th/0306138); the common
positive-shift estimate and its restricted conclusion are given above.

Since $\delta P=-A\delta A-\delta A A$, cyclicity of this common
regulated trace, justified with spectral cutoffs before removal, yields

$$\boxed{\delta\Gamma_{\rm PV,\eta}
=-\tfrac12\operatorname{Tr}_{/\mathcal T}(\delta P R_\eta)
=-\operatorname{Tr}_{/\mathcal T}(\delta A S_\eta).}$$

This concerns the combined regulator expression. It does not split the
individual ultraviolet-divergent mass traces. The estimates depend on
$\eta$ and do not establish their uniformity as $\eta\downarrow0$.

For an exact finite representation respecting the congruence, a separate
metric-variation identity is

$$\delta\log\det(P_\kappa+m^2)
=2\operatorname{Re}\operatorname{Tr}
[(H_m+i\kappa)^{-1}\{\delta H_0+m\delta(N\beta)\}]
-2\operatorname{Tr}(N^{-1}\delta N).$$

The lapse term cancels in the common PV sum. The mass-dependent term in
$\delta H_m$ must remain. This finite identity does not authorize factoring
separate infinite-dimensional determinants or replacing a conforming
squared form by a squared compressed first-order matrix.

### Zero modes and the remaining limit

A simple exact control prevents an incorrect state identification. With
$H_0=0$, $N=I$ and $\beta=\operatorname{diag}(1,-1)$, positive mass
fills one zero-energy component as it tends to zero. Negative mass fills
the other. Their average occupies each by one half; the declared massless
state occupies neither. Thus small mass alone does not select the
empty-zero prescription.

In the finite-dimensional control, the zero-cluster splitting is
$m(P_0NP_0)\beta$. Its sign is $\operatorname{sgn}(m)\beta$ on that
cluster, since $P_0NP_0$ is positive and commutes with $\beta$.
For an infinite-dimensional operator with unbounded $N$, isolation and
finite multiplicity alone do not justify this expansion: the required
$N$ form/domain conditions and perturbation theorem must also hold.
The massless full-Dirac metric probe anticommutes with $\beta$, making
both $\operatorname{Tr}(P_0\delta H_0)$ and
$\operatorname{Tr}(\beta P_0\delta H_0)$ zero. This removes that
isolated-cluster contribution to this probe, not every zero-mode observable
or the embedded continuum-threshold problem. It also does not prove
differentiability of a massless vacuum energy through a zero crossing.

The proved fixed-frequency limit can be taken first, followed by the
previous Hamiltonian low-energy frequency limit with explicit zero
prescription. For $E_*<\infty$, that second step is controlled in local
differentiated kernel norms by the gap-free lemma above. This ordered
construction does not yet show that the original proper-$P$ response,
integrated over all frequencies before $\eta\to0$, has the same limit.

**Next unresolved decision:** control the joint small-mass/small-frequency
corner in the compact, stress-differentiated kernel with the declared state
and ultraviolet subtraction, or derive the source directly from the
declared covariance with an explicitly matched local prescription. Do not
redo the positive-mass identity or another radial basis sweep to answer
this question. Spatial remainder control and fixed-scheme $M\to\infty$
removal remain necessary before reporting the physical source value.

### Controls and literature scope

Ten executable controls pass for a six-dimensional factorization with
noncommuting lapse and Hamiltonian, lapse maxima 2, 10 and 100, three
frequencies and three positive shifts. Maximum normalized inverse,
variation and PV-sum discrepancies are below $2.2\times10^{-14}$.
The wrong-frequency substitution and the zero-occupation mismatch are
detected explicitly. This is an algebra benchmark, not continuum evidence.
The script records exact source/input hashes and reproduces the
[PNG](../figures/dirac_green_mass_limit_progress.png) and
[PDF](../figures/dirac_green_mass_limit_progress.pdf).

Static Dirac Wick rotation is developed in
[Muller, arXiv:1002.3263, sections3 and5](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1002.3263),
but its assumption A1 bounds both $q=1/N$ and its inverse. It cannot be
applied directly to this exterior's unbounded lapse. The compact-domain
argument above addresses precisely that issue; novelty is not claimed.
The self-adjoint closures remain those justified in the earlier sections
using [Bandara--Saratchandran](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06190).

## Uniform low-energy limit and zero-state test

Increment152 advances the actual infrared question from151. The results
below are conditional analytic statements for the specified operator family,
with a counterexample to a tempting unrestricted argument. No physical
supporting stress or chronology-changing geometry is obtained.
The [executable controls](../scripts/dirac_infrared_corner.py) and
[results](../results/dirac_infrared_corner_results.json) use explicitly
illustrative spectral measures and an abstract operator, not fitted bridge data.

### Uniform local smoothing removes the need for a spectral gap

Let $\theta\in C_c^\infty(\mathbb R)$ be real, even and one near zero.
For compactly supported differential operators $L_i$, put

$$A_{i,m}=L_i\theta(H_m),\qquad
C_i=\sup_{|m|\le m_0}\|A_{i,m}\|_2.$$

The norm $\|\cdot\|_2$ here is Hilbert--Schmidt; $\|\cdot\|_1$ below
is trace norm. On any fixed compact set, the coefficients of $H_m$ and
their derivatives are uniformly bounded for bounded $m$. Local elliptic
estimates and the bounded spectral support of $\theta$ give, for every $s$,
uniform maps $A_{i,m}:L^2\to H^s(K)$.
Choose a fixed local Laplacian basis with eigenvalues $\lambda_n$ and
projection $\Pi_J$. The resulting singular-value tail obeys

$$\|(I-\Pi_J)A_{i,m}\|_2^2
\le C_s^2\sum_{n>J}(1+\lambda_n)^{-s}.$$

Taking $s>\dim\Sigma/2$ makes this uniformly summable. Strong functional
calculus from151 gives adjoint strong convergence, first on smooth compact
test sections and then by the uniform operator bounds. Finite-rank rows
plus the uniform tail therefore prove

$$\boxed{A_{i,m}\longrightarrow A_{i,0}
\quad\hbox{in Hilbert--Schmidt norm}.}$$

This uses compact coefficient bounds, not a global upper bound on $N$.
Define the missing small-frequency factor

$$g_\epsilon(\lambda)=\frac2\pi\operatorname{sgn}(\lambda)
\arctan\frac\epsilon{|\lambda|},\quad g_\epsilon(0)=0,
\qquad T_{m,\epsilon}=A_{1,m}g_\epsilon(H_m)A_{2,m}^*.$$

With $E_m^\delta=\mathbf1_{[-\delta,\delta]}(H_m)$ and
$B_i(m,\delta)=\|A_{i,m}E_m^\delta\|_2$, split the spectrum to obtain

$$\boxed{\|T_{m,\epsilon}\|_1
\le B_1(m,\delta)B_2(m,\delta)
+\frac{2\epsilon}{\pi\delta}C_1C_2.}$$

Choose endpoints $\pm\delta$ carrying no $H_0$ spectral atoms.
Strong spectral-projection convergence and the Hilbert--Schmidt result give

$$B_i(m,\delta)\to B_i(0,\delta),\qquad
B_i(0,\delta)\to\|A_{i,0}P_0\|_2\quad(\delta\downarrow0),$$

where $P_0=\mathbf1_{\{0\}}(H_0)$. The interval must include zero:
deleting it at $m=0$ would invalidate the first limit.
If $P_0=0$, first choosing $\delta$, then small $m,\epsilon$, proves
$T_{m,\epsilon}\to0$ jointly without restricting $\epsilon/|m|$.
Repeating for every differentiated $L_i$ and applying Sobolev embedding
on $K\times K$ gives local $C^r$ kernel convergence for every finite $r$.
This covers a differentiated diagonal on this bounded-energy part.

With fixed $I-P_0$ projections on both external legs, the same statement
holds off the exact-zero space even when $P_0\ne0$. Without projection,
the displayed bound retains the localized zero-space contribution. There
is no numerical rate for the actual geometry until its spectral weight is bounded.

### A sufficient condition for the zero states

There is an additional criterion for the actual proper-space Dirac family.
Write $B=N^{-1/2}$ and let

$$T=\overline{N^{-1/2}H_0N^{-1/2}}$$

be the self-adjoint spatial Dirac operator on the complete physical metric.
It anticommutes with $\beta$. The same maximal-domain reasoning as151 gives
the bounded inverse identity, for $m\ne0$,

$$H_m^{-1}=B(T+m\beta)^{-1}B.$$

Since $(T+m\beta)^2=T^2+m^2$, spectral calculus yields, for $m\downarrow0$,

$$mH_m^{-1}\longrightarrow\beta C\quad\hbox{strongly},
\qquad C=B\mathbf1_{\{0\}}(T)B\ge0.$$

The support of $C$ is exactly

$$\overline{\ker H_0\cap D(N^{1/2})}.$$

Indeed, $y=Bv$ for $v\in\ker T$ is a zero vector of $H_0$ with
$N^{1/2}y\in L^2$; conversely any such weighted zero vector maps to
$\ker T$ by the maximal-domain argument. Thus a sufficient condition is

$$\boxed{\overline{\ker H_0\cap D(N^{1/2})}=\ker H_0.}$$

Under this condition, the limit spectral measure of every zero vector
for $\beta C$ has no atom at zero. Applying bounded functional calculus
to $mH_m^{-1}$ proves

$$\operatorname{sgn}(H_{\pm m})P_0\to\pm\beta P_0
\quad\hbox{strongly}.$$

Together with convergence off $P_0$, the averaged signs tend to
$\operatorname{sgn}H_0$. The averaged occupations still differ from the
declared empty-zero state by $P_0/2$. Their contribution to this particular
full-Dirac metric probe vanishes because $\{\beta,\delta H_0\}=0$;
the states are not identical for arbitrary observables.

This also controls the signed-mass average of the joint corner. For
$a=|m|$, write

$$g_\epsilon(H_{\pm a})
=\frac2\pi\arctan\left[\frac\epsilon a(aH_{\pm a}^{-1})\right].$$

On $P_0$, along $\epsilon/a\to r<\infty$ the limits are
$\pm\beta(2/\pi)\arctan(rC)$, and cancel. For $r=0$, the uniform
bound $\|aH_{\pm a}^{-1}\|\le1/c_N$ gives zero directly. For
$r\to\infty$, splitting the limit spectral measure at continuity
points $\pm\delta$ makes its small-eigenvalue weight vanish, while
the error outside is at most $2/(\pi r\delta)$. The limits are then
$\pm\beta P_0$, again cancelling. Off $P_0$, the preceding joint estimate
applies. The Hilbert--Schmidt convergence upgrades this signed average
to local trace norm and every finite differentiated-kernel norm.
No operator-norm convergence or restriction on the rate ratio is asserted.

Compact mass-dependent metric insertions contribute $O(m)$ on this band.
The weighted-zero criterion is **not yet verified for the sewn geometry**.
Proving that its kernel vanishes would also suffice. In spatial notation,
the extra weight tests $\int_\Sigma N|\psi|^2\,d\mathrm{vol}_h$;
ordinary normalization tests only $\int_\Sigma|\psi|^2\,d\mathrm{vol}_h$.

### Counterexample: algebraic symmetries alone do not suffice

The following abstract example satisfies the algebraic and common-core
assumptions but is not a local elliptic Dirac operator. On $L^2(0,1)$ set

$$\psi(x)=1,\quad u(x)=x,\quad
K=M_x-2|u\rangle\langle u|,\quad N_s=M_{x^{-3}},$$
$$H_0=\begin{pmatrix}K&0\\0&-K\end{pmatrix},\quad
\Gamma=\sigma_z,\quad\beta=\sigma_x,\quad
H_m=H_0+m\operatorname{diag}(N_s,N_s)\beta.$$

Weighted Cauchy--Schwarz proves $K\ge0$ and $\ker K=\operatorname{span}\psi$.
The rank-one perturbation preserves the essential threshold at zero.
$H_m$ is self-adjoint on $D(N_s)^2$ for $m\ne0$, with a common compact
smooth core and the previously proved gap $|m|$. All the stated $\beta$
and $\Gamma$ symmetries hold, but $\psi\notin D(N_s^{1/2})$.

Put $Q_m=K+imN_s$, $D_m=M_{x+imx^{-3}}$ and
$v_m=x^4/(x^4+im)$. The rank-one inverse formula has denominator

$$d_m=1-2\int_0^1\frac{x^5}{x^4+im}\,dx
=\sqrt{im}\arctan\frac1{\sqrt{im}}.$$

It gives $Q_m^{-1}=D_m^{-1}+(2/d_m)|v_m\rangle\langle\bar v_m|$.
Here $v_m\to\psi$ in $L^2$ and

$$\sqrt m\,Q_m^{-1}\longrightarrow
a|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\quad\hbox{in operator norm},
\qquad a=\frac4\pi e^{-i\pi/4}.$$

For an explicit bound, let $C_8=\pi/[8\sin(\pi/8)]$ and
$C_D=3^{3/8}/2$. Then $\|v_m-\psi\|^2\le C_8m^{1/4}$ and

$$\|\sqrt m Q_m^{-1}-a|\psi\rangle\langle\psi|\|
\le C_Dm^{1/4}+|2\sqrt m/d_m-a|+2|a|\sqrt{C_8}m^{1/8}.$$

To justify the sign, write $Q_m=U_m|Q_m|$. The polar unitary of
$\sqrt m Q_m^{-1}$ is $U_m^\dagger$. Norm convergence of that inverse
and its absolute value implies $U_m^\dagger\psi\to e^{-i\pi/4}\psi$,
hence $U_m\psi\to e^{i\pi/4}\psi$. A fixed Pauli rotation puts $H_m$
into off-diagonal blocks $Q_m,Q_m^\dagger$, proving full vector convergence
on its rank-two zero space:

$$\operatorname{sgn}(H_{\pm m})P_0
\longrightarrow\frac{\Gamma\pm\beta}{\sqrt2}P_0.$$

Thus the averaged sign tends to $\Gamma P_0/\sqrt2$, not zero.
For the finite-rank probe $V=\Gamma P_0$, which is $\beta$-odd and
$\Gamma$-even, the averaged parity-even zero contribution is

$$-\frac12\operatorname{Tr}\left[\frac\Gamma{\sqrt2}P_0V\right]
=-\frac1{\sqrt2},$$

while declared empty zeros contribute zero. This disproves an argument
using only those abstract symmetries. It does not disprove convergence
for the actual sewn differential operator or establish a physical negative source.

### Verification and the next physical decision

Eleven controls pass. For an illustrative continuous spectral density on
$0\le p\le1$, the low-frequency envelope is bounded uniformly in $m$ by

$$\frac2\pi\int_0^1\arctan\frac\epsilon p\,dp
=\frac2\pi\left[\arctan\epsilon+
\frac\epsilon2\log(1+\epsilon^{-2})\right]\longrightarrow0.$$

Numerical quadrature reproduces this expression to $2.8\times10^{-17}$;
three independent mass/cutoff paths obey it. A separate zero atom shows
path-dependent individual limits, which alone do not prove failure of
the physical metric probe. The counterexample denominator, vector bound
and non-$\beta$ limit are independently checked. These illustrative
measures are not estimates of the unknown bridge spectral density.

Next establish the actual zero-mode weighted condition, or its absence,
and control the high-Hamiltonian-energy contribution with the common
ultraviolet subtraction. Bounded Hamiltonian energy is not low proper-$P$
spectrum. Full fixed-$M$ source convergence, spatial remainder bounds and
the fixed-scheme $M\to\infty$ limit remain open. A Hadamard state's local
existence does not by itself prove convergence of this regulator family;
the [ground-state microlocal result](https://arxiv.org/abs/math-ph/0002021)
addresses a different statement. Likewise,
[flat-space decaying-potential zero-mode asymptotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/0707.3008)
do not supply the required weighted estimate in the Melvin exterior.

This increment also qualifies151's zero-cluster expansion: outside finite
matrices, the needed $N$ domain and perturbation hypotheses must be checked.

The next geometry-specific test can be stated precisely. In the canonical
exterior normalization $u_\mu=P\sqrt{\rho/N}\,\psi_\mu$, prove a
sectorwise estimate $\|\sqrt N u_\mu\|_2\le C_\mu\|u_\mu\|_2$ for
every exact sewn zero solution. A constant uniform in $\mu$ is unnecessary
for density: axial projections reduce the Hamiltonian and commute with $N$,
so finite-sector truncations suffice. The
[actual canonical operator](DIHOLE_DIRAC_DOMAIN.md) is

$$H_\mu=-i\sigma_x(v\partial_\rho+v_\rho/2)
-i\sigma_z(v\partial_z+v_z/2)+\sigma_yW_\mu.$$

Its squared form needs large-$\rho$ coefficient estimates uniform in $z$,
including joint radial/axial escape. The
[existing Melvin reference modes](../scripts/melvin_leads.py) already have
finite polynomial lapse moments; repeating their count does not prove
this estimate for the actual dihole-coupled and sewn zero solutions.
